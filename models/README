# 🧠 Models Directory

This directory contains trained Machine Learning models used for:

- Behavioral prediction of next customer issues
- Issue encoding and pattern learning

## 🚫 Not Included in Repository
For security, size, and best-practice reasons, the following files are **not** included in GitHub:
- `.pkl` model files
- Encoders
- Training artifacts

## 📌 Notes
- Models are trained offline
- Stored securely (e.g., Hugging Face, private storage)
- Loaded dynamically at runtime

This ensures:
✔ Better security  
✔ Cleaner repository  
✔ Production-grade MLOps practices
